# Linked list (Связный список)

**Is** - A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements. Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays, data elements are not stored at contiguous locations.

## Types

- singly
- doubly
- circular

## Advantages:

- it could store items in different locations in memory
- dynamic insert and delete

## Disadvantages

- Has no access by index
- Difficult some other operations except insert and delete (we should iterate over all list to update some element for example)

# Stack abstract data structure (ADS)

We can place or remove one item from the top of the stack only **(LIFO)**. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only.

# Queue

Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue) **(FIFO)**.
